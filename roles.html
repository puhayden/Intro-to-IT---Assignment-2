<p style="font-size:20px">In this project, our team has each has their own allocated roles that were distributed towards the beginning of the project. These roles are not specific roles but informal roles that can change over the duration of the project.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Chalani acts as a quality assurance member who is constantly refining the quality of work done and making changes as needed. She also provides assistance to other members who may need a further hand in their role. This role is important as there is less room for errors and it ensures that the quality of work produced is within our timeframe, expectations and meets the project brief.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Samantha is mainly responsible for team meetings and gatherings. She acts as a designated recorder whenever she can. Her role is crucial to our project as it creates the team meetings, records them and documents the key points of our gathering allowing us the team to have a clear understanding of the direction of the project prior to the next meeting. </p>
<p style="font-size:20px">When it comes to our project research, Alexander is our designated researcher whose main role is to dig further into the technologies involved with our project idea “Downstream”. Alongside his extensive knowledge and understanding of the technicalities involved, by researching the important aspects to the creation of our project he is able to ensure that there is a solid foundation for development. This makes his role extremely important to the completion of this project.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Matthew’s role within the project involves tabling, collection of data and the organisation of our roles and responsibilities. It allows the team to know how much contribution is being made while also how much work has been completed and what needs to be done through Microsoft Excel. This creates organisation and ensures steady flow within the project, as each member has an idea of the roles of themselves and others and their progress. Ontop of that, he also fills in the tasks that need to be done and assists with adjustments if needed. His talent to deal with numbers and statistics while effectively use Excel, compile data and display them graphically makes both him and his role a unique addition. In addition to the report, there is an importance in maintaining and creating the HTML element of the project. </p>
<p style="font-size:20px">
Hayden is responsible for the HTML coding, layout and the creation of the GitHub repository and website in will be presented. He also acts as a fill for any parts that other members have not selected. While everyone is contributing to the GitHub Website with their own changes, this is the role that manages the design of the project website through the use of CSS, controlling the layout and making changes to the font and colours to make the website pop. They are merely responsible for the presentation of the website. This role is important as it impacts the quality of the website presented and without it, would create many difficulties in organising the creation of the HTML website.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">Liam has adapted multiple roles within the project, making him a very versatile addition to the team. Alongside Hayden, he is assisting with the design of the website as a result of his experience of the use  JavaScript and CSS to make the website shine even more. Liam is also responsible for the describing and detailing the information about the project idea. “Downstream” is initially his project idea, therefore he is able to talk more indepth about his vision and how he intends for the application to be developed and used by other people. These two roles are very important and provide a sense of direction when it comes to creating prototypes and design in the project.
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">
During the first few weeks of the project, these roles are unchanged and stay the same until further towards the deadline of the project. Once the written aspect is finalised and prototyping begins, there will be multiple roles for the creation of the prototypes. Each member will contribute and assist in the development of interactive mockups while also adding their own work towards the GitHub page. While some roles will stay consistent throughout the project such as the management of team meetings which should not be changed until the end of the project.
