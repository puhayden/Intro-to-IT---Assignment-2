<p style="font-size:18px">Hi, my full name is Liam Thomas Bentley (s3928558). I am a part of THUR Assignment 2 Group #25. Born in Shepparton, raised in Bendigo, I moved from Bendigo to Melbourne to study a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT as a mature age student. I previously studied a Bachelor of Commerce at Deakin University, with a particular focus on contractual law, though I did not proceed with my second year of the course due to a change in career direction. In my personal time I play in amateur esports tournaments with friends for competitive first-person shooter games, such as Rainbow Six Siege and Counter Strike: Global Offensive. If I am not spending time with friends, working, studying, or gaming, then I am usually at the gym or walking my golden retriever, Henry. My experience with IT is limited to home done PC builds and some basic experience with some commercial electrical networking and setup, it is my goal to expand on my current knowledge and experience over the extent of my course at RMIT. My current interest lies in the fields of cyber security, as well as web development.

<p style="font-size:18px">Hi I’m Hayden!  (s3948965). I am currently studying a Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT. Some quick facts about me.. my birthday is the 22nd of February and my background is Timorese. My parents come from a small country called East Timor located near Indonesia. In my family of 6, it consists of myself, mother and father and finally my 3 older brothers with me being the youngest of them all.

My IT Interest lies within IT hardware such as computer parts and pc building which i hopes to eventually build upon during studies at RMIT. Despite my strong interest in IT, I haven't been able to have any proper IT experience as of yet so i could really say that i’m beginner level with my only experience being  using a computer. But I'm continually seeking to gain and learn more about what the IT world offers.</p>

<img src="alexander-photo.PNG" alt="Alexander Profile Photo" style="width:180px; height:135px">
<p style="font-size:18px">​​Hello! I’m Alexander (s3951539) and I am a current student of RMIT. I had previously transferred from Swinburne University after a very long string of issues stemming back from 2016 when I began the degree. I am Italian Australian, both parents are Italian - however I was born here. My hobbies outside of Tech are Astrology, looking at it more as a whole rather than just horoscopes - keeping in mind correlation doesn’t mean causation, working with video - I have not done any projects as such - but doing post-production of videos using Final Cut Pro X and watching an endless amount tv, notably watching 24 seasons of the simpsons in 3 weeks. I also would deem myself a casual gamer between PS5, Switch and PC - currently playing through Bayonetta on Switch and Trying to get into Elden Ring on PS5. My interest in IT started from as young as i can remember, but it has still remained strong to this day as I do like the problem solving aspect of the tech industry, i do regularly do small repairs for those people who i do know - but also in maintaining said solutions, such as small networking solutions i have implemented in said peoples houses also. In saying I have done small repairs, as for formal experience - I have not held a job in the tech field, however I would be entirely open to it. I do hold a Certificate III from 2014 with Holmesglen done as part of my VCE, which would probably only require a certificate IV to keep me updated, and I have my Diploma from Swinburne which allowed me to proceed onto finishing my degree here at RMIT.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Hey! My name is Matthew (s3948263), and I’m in my first year of a Bachelors Degree in IT at RMIT! I’ve come straight out of high school, and I’m looking forward to learning lots while I’m here. I’m Australian for at least five generations in any direction, so nothing too interesting. I have a wide variety of hobbies, including video games, board games, Dungeons and Dragons, and any type of logic puzzle. I’m mainly a PC gamer (although the Nintendo Wii was a big part of my childhood, and I’m happy to have a conversation about almost every topic. I’m pretty easy to get along with, regardless of if we share interests. A couple of facts about me are that I’m a Christian, I can play the guitar, I didn’t own a phone until I was 15, and I have never had coffee or alcohol. You’ll find me playing something like Hollow Knight, cracking jokes, sitting down with a board game, or having a passionate discussion about the merits of, well, pretty much anything. I can also sniff out free food from a mile away because that Uni Student Budget is kinda low. My brain is wired in such a way that I’m hopeless at creativity, but a madman when it comes to solving problems. And really, IT is just about identifying and solving problems. Also technology runs in the family, so I’m pretty comfortable with it for the most part. I’m hoping to come out of RMIT with new skills and new friends made along the way.</p>

<!-- Team Profile comparison with personality tests outcome -->
<h3 style="font-size:30px"><strong><u>Team Profile - 3 Test Outcome Comparison</u></strong></h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">Our team has 6 members in total, and they are Hayden, Alexander, Liam, Samantha, Matthew and Chalani. According to the personality tests carried out in Assignment 1, we have been able to gain some valuable insights of each member’s personality. For instance, according to the 3 tests, Chalani can be considered as an extraverted person who prefers to socialise with people while being open to new ideas. Also, her necessity to organise tasks in advance with highest standards is one of the key features which is essential to this project. Hayden, on the other hand is considered to be an introvert who loves to observe things without hurrying into conclusions. This type of personality would clearly help our team to identify important details that otherwise would go unnoticed. Alexander’s personality tests reflect that he has a combination of introvert, observant thinker and prospecting type of personality. It means that he tends to have a varying approach towards tasks as needed. Furthermore, Liam’s results clearly highlight his extrovert and socialising personality along with his openness to new ideas and the ability to coordinate tasks. Similarly, Samantha also has an extrovert personality open to new ideas and the passion to work together with team members to achieve project goals. Additionally, her test results show that she has an intuitive nature which can be an advantage when working on difficult project tasks. Finally, Matthew’s results indicate that he has an extraverted personality. It means that he enjoys having people around and to share ideas with them. In a group project environment, his personality of helping others when in need is one of the most important qualities according to the test results. Last but not least, the test outcomes highlight the fact that his nature of being an optimistic person would help himself and everyone around him to achieve great success. These identified characteristics of all group members covering a wide range of personalities will help us thrive through all challenges that we would face throughout this project work.

<!-- GROUP PROCESSES -->
<h3 style="font-size:30px"><strong><u>Group Processes</u></strong></h3>
<p style="font-size:18px">The THURS Group # 25 for Introduction to Information Technology has 6 team members, and they are: Samantha, Chalani, Hayden, Liam, Alexander and Matthew.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">In Assignment 2, the group had some difficulties at the beginning of the assignment in organising various group meetings through Microsoft Teams due to poor communication among team members and the lack of a proper meeting plan. However, the cohesion of the team members and their willingness to achieve good grades in Assignment 2 have encouraged everyone to take immediate actions and to set up proper meeting dates twice per week even if it was a bit behind time. Firstly, after brainstorming ideas we have decided to split and allocate various parts of the assignment to each team member taking into consideration their capabilities and passion towards certain topics specified in the assignment specifications. Secondly, we have agreed to set up a few soft deadlines to edit, revise and to format report content with the assumption to finalise various project areas prior to the hard deadline. The main goal of  the soft deadlines was to finalise the writing contents of the report in order to have a considerable amount of time to dedicate on GitHub, HTML coding and CSS styling before the assignment due date. Furthermore, weekly organised group meetings helped all the team members to streamline and support each other whenever they encountered any difficulties in allocated sections, or any other issue related to the technical side of GitHub as well as with HTML coding. Also, the usage of communication platforms like Microsoft Teams and the usage of Google Docs not only facilitated us to monitor the progress updates of each member but also to provide feedback to each other’s work and to verify whether the assigned portion of work adhered to the assignment rubric specifications to obtain full marks. Additionally, keeping a track of GitHub log activity has been very useful to keep an eye on the progress of HTML codes and CSS styling of the project. Moreover, working with team members who have different personalities, capabilities, strengths and skills have been very helpful for knowledge sharing as well as to achieve desired goals. In fact, most of the personality tests result outcomes gained  for each team member in Assignment 1 revealed to be in line with the behaviours and attitudes that they have demonstrated during the Assignment 2. For instance, Samantha’s energy, motivation and punctuality helped the entire team to have well organised team meetings with excellent outcomes. Chalani’s organising skills and planning ahead not only demonstrated her good leadership qualities but also her capability to make sure that no one missed their work, and they are on track have been much appreciated. Hayden on the other hand with his calm yet observant character, assisted the team by putting up a mind-blowing web page to host all the report content as well as to offer help to team members struggling with HTML coding and styling. Moreover, Alexander’s flexibility to adapt to any situation as per the requirement has been a great advantage to overcome obstacles came with the Assignment 2. Also, his previously acquired in-depth knowledge in various IT related subjects has been a plus point while covering different project tasks. In addition, Liam’s innovative project ideas along with his positive attitude in handling any difficult/unpredictable situation within the group has ensured a smooth and efficient workflow. Finally, Matthew not only has been a very good team member who continuously looked after any team member in need of assistance but also made sure to create a  dedicated Microsoft Excel sheet to track the progress of each team member’s work. The spreadsheet created by Matthew enabled other team members to tick off their finalised work gradually and this in turn updated a pie chart which represented the progress percentage of the whole project.
</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">However, reflecting back on Assignment 2, we have to admit that there have been few difficulties and unpredictable situations that we had to face in the course of the project work. To begin with, the group had difficulties in gathering all group members together during Teams meetings. In fact, lack of pre planning all the upcoming meeting dates and times affected most of the soft deadlines as well as created stressful situations during the project. Also, a group member was unable to deliver the assigned portion of work on time before the Assignment deadline due to lack of communication and responsibility. It has not only created a stressful situation among remaining group members but also resulted in forcing other team members to deliver the project report with a missing part. However, this team member apologised for the inconvenience caused and mentioned that he will not let the same to happen with future projects.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Despite the difficulties faced during Assignment 2, all team members agree on the fact that working on group projects have enhanced our individual capabilities and it has benefited our teamwork skills. Also, the cohesion of the team and the well understanding of each other’s personalities, strengths and weaknesses led us to successfully complete the assigned tasks and to acknowledge the areas to be improved when approaching future group work.</p>

<p style="font-size:18px">Finally, there are a number of changes that we will be introducing for Assignment 3 in order to achieve better grades in the future. For instance, we are looking forward to planning and setting up dates and times for team meetings in the beginning of the Assignment 3 which will let us work with peace of mind and carry out the deliveries while respecting all the soft deadlines for the completion of specific tasks. There will be 2 meetings per week on Teams and each group member is expected to be present with a functioning web camera and microphone. In case a team member is unable to attend a meeting, they are expected to re-watch the recorded meeting on Teams or to ask another team member to summarise what has been discussed during the meeting. Moreover, we will strictly adhere and respect soft deadlines to achieve meaningful outcomes and to avoid last minute pressure. Lastly, we will make sure to use all the available communication platforms effectively and efficiently to maintain good and harmonious communication among team members.
