<p style="font-size:18px">Working with team members of THURS Group #25 has been very interesting and enjoyable. In fact, collaborating with team members who have various cultural backgrounds, personalities, ideas and skills has been very useful to successfully achieve Assignment 3 goals. As a group, we have been able to improve many aspects of teamwork compared to the previous Assignment 2. As a matter of fact, we have been able to early plan all the meetings ahead, created an excel sheet to keep a track of the progress of each team member's assigned work, and above all we have been able to respect all the soft deadlines. Although we were able to improve our capabilities of teamwork over the course of the group assignments, if there is anything that we could get further improved, that would be our team coordination skills. One thing that I have learned while working in a group is that planning ahead and everyone’s equal contribution to the project will lead us to complete and deliver a quality project on time with peace of mind. One surprising thing that I have noticed in each team member are as follows: Samantha’s ability to efficiently lead weekly group meetings on Teams, Liam’s impeccable attention to detail, Alexander’s knowledge in Information Technology field, Matthew’s ability to create extraordinary excel spreadsheets to track the progress and interface designing and last but not least Hayden’s energy and the capability to style and make attractive HTML pages. Overall, as a team we are happy about our team and the deliveries.

<p style="font-size:18px">The process of completing Assignment 3 was a big improvement from the previous assignment in terms of organisation, communication and team effort. Before starting this assignment, we had a team meeting that went through all the emotions and feelings we had about assignment 2 and how we should improve. A big factor that was talked about was organisation, we decided early on to split up the work and set hard deadlines for people to follow in order to ensure that all report sections were completed and present in time for submission. During this meeting, we also talked about our faults, one was communication that could be improved on, which I believe this time round was a lot better as we all took this assignment seriously as individuals as well as a team. Matthew was determined and took a leadership-like role by setting meeting times, communicating regularly on our collective whatsapp group chat which is a big improvement from Assignment 2, he also took the responsibility of figma after a miscommunication within the group. Hayden completed his work on time and helped a lot with the technical side (html and figma) and an overall good team member. Alex finished his work early and attended meetings frequently. Chalani communicated efficiently and completed her work on time as well, she was great at reminding members of specifics concerning the rubric and the specifications. Liam completed his work effectively and took a primary role in html.

<h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Alexander</em></strong></h4>
<p style="font-size:18px"> Assignment 3 definitely had a stronger start for us. We continued discussions within days and got right back to work, balancing any other existing priorities. We had definitely improved on communication, notably having all members of our group present during every meeting – as well as present during Consultation with Anthony. We had gotten better with showing progress on our central document to show how we were progressing along with the assignment. As for points of improvement to be made for future group assignments, having slightly better communication – more in terms of content updates, perhaps having some form of progress by the time each group meeting had happened (unless explained for prior) although for the most part – we had improved on it quite a lot and got better with asking for help. An aspect which surprised me with each team member – Matthew had kept ontop of his work consistently throughout, without slipping up as he did in A2 – and more often actually took part in coordinating meeting times, Chalani had consistently kept in regular communication with all of us and reminding us of rubric requirements, Liam’s attention to detail on the project with html and the idea – keeping us informed with his original vision for the project so that the group could help make it into something more, Samantha had upkept her energy to lead group meetings as effectively as A2 and Hayden’s attention to detail with HTML as well as the Figma prototype. Throughout working on this assignment, it has only further backed how important communication was throughout the whole assignment – even if it is was only minor updates.
