<!-- IDEAL JOBS COMPARISON -->
<h3 style="font-size:30px"><strong><u>Ideal Jobs Comparison</u></strong></h3>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">The ideal jobs chosen by the 6 team members have some common elements among them. All these 6 positions require tertiary or above educational qualifications. Most preferably a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology or similar. Moreover, applicants are required to adhere to company standards as well as to ensure a smooth workflow while working alongside with other staff and customers. In addition to this, most of these organisations expect their potential candidates to possess excellent verbal and written communication skills as well as the ability to work under pressure with minimum supervision as key features to perform well.</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Team members have chosen job roles which are related to different industries. For instance, Hayden and Chalani both chose two IT jobs which are interrelated since both of them consist in providing technical support to medical informatic devices. In this case, we are talking about working in the HealthCare and Biomedical industries. Most importantly, these IT positions consist of working and spending most of the time alongside medical professionals and experts. On the other hand, Samantha’s selection as her ideal job is the Lighting Supervisor position. This type of role requires a vast knowledge on how to use IT technologies and software to obtain quality and high standard lighting systems for different types of events. Furthermore, Liam’s choice for his ideal job is Software Developer. Software developers' roles differentiates from others due to the fact that it consists in designing, developing, coding and testing of softwares. As a matter of fact, software developers are expected to be working using different types of programming languages to deliver quality software products. In addition, Matthew has chosen the role of a Data Analyst as his ideal job. The role of Data analyst helps organisations and its clients by collecting, interpreting and structuring data sets using SQL, PivotTable and Excel. Technical skills required for this type of job position are in-depth knowledge of programming languages, statistics, maths and database query tools. Finally, Alexander’s ideal job is System Administrator for an E-commerce organisation. The role of System Administrator is tasked with maintaining and troubleshooting any IT related issues and to provide efficient solutions to those issues in a timely manner.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">Career plans across the group are very similar due to the fact that each member has chosen a career which has a strong connection to the Information Technology stream. IT is a field which is rapidly evolving which helps the society’s betterment. As a result, all team members are willing to learn and improve their knowledge in Information Technology by undertaking a Bachelor’s degree in Information Technology and they look forward to completing other IT related certifications to stay up to date due to its fast evolving nature. The noted differences among team members' careers are mainly due to various sub-streams. For instance, Hayden’s and Chalani’s ideal jobs are connected to the Healthcare industry while Samantha’s choice falls into the animation, film and entertainment field. Liam's chosen field is software engineering, whereas Matthew’s ideal job is mainly related to industries like business and finance. Also, Alexander has chosen the system administration pathway.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 20px;">However, in-depth knowledge in computer science and Information Technology remains as the most important requirement for all these roles.</p>

<!-- Career Plans -->

<h2 style="font-size:40px; text-align:center">Career Plans</h2>
<h3 style="font-size:30px"><strong><u>Plan to obtain required Skills, Qualifications and Experience</u></strong></h3>

    <ul>

      <!-- Chalani -->
      <li><h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Chalani</em></strong></h4></li>
      <p style="font-size:18px">I am planning to complete my Bachelor’s in Information Technology at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology to obtain the required skills to be an Informatics Systems Engineer. Additionally, I am looking forward to enhancing my previously acquired knowledge in Biology to help me succeed in this role. Moreover, I would like to take Cloud technology related certifications to improve myself on Cloud Technologies since biomedical solutions are rapidly moving on to Cloud platforms. Furthermore, by actively participating on group projects at RMIT University, I look forward to gaining more experience in teamwork and coordination.</p>
      <br></br>

      <!-- Samantha -->
      <li><h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Samantha</em></strong></h4></li>
      <p style="font-size:18px">My plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience needed for the position of ‘Lighting Supervisor’ at Industrial Light & Magic would firstly to complete my Bachelor’s in Information Technology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. Since the ‘Lighting Supervisor’ is a senior position, I would most likely have had to work several years in the technology department in the film industry to qualify for this position such as, technicians,  By working multiple years prior will garner me the experience and exposure needed to have a senior position looking after other technicians underneath my supervision.  I would also potentially need to further my tertiary studies by completing a diploma or a Master of Science specialising in Computer science to further my understanding on software systems, heuristic optimisation and data analytics that could possibly assist in this position.</p>
      <br></br>

      <!-- Hayden -->
      <li><h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Hayden</em></strong></h4></li>
      <p style="font-size:18px">In order to obtain the skills required for the position of IT technician, I hope to complete a Bachelor of Information Technology. During this degree I will be able to acquire and improve my programming skills with languages such as python and may change my courses so that I am able to learn other programming languages such as Java and C++. In my second year, I would pick up an elective that goes into further on IT networking and the way it works. By the end of the course, I should have acquired the fundamental skills and basics of IT. To further improve my skills, I will get an internship in an IT place to experience working in the field of IT as a technician and if needed do additional degrees.</p>
      <br></br>

      <!-- Liam -->
      <li><h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Liam</em></strong></h4></li>
      <p style="font-size:18px">To reach the position of Software Developer I will require not only an expansion on my technical knowledge and skills, but also to acquire my Bachelor of Information Technology as well as potentially a Bachelor of Computer Science to be fully qualified and desirable as an employment prospect. Over the course of my time at RMIT I will be seeking opportunities for internships at companies that would provide experience in my relevant field of software development. I want to use the opportunities afforded to me while at university to network and build connections to offer potential future prospects. After completing my course which will take 3-5 years depending on whether I pick up a Computer Science course in the next year, I will be seeking an entry level graduate role at a Melbourne based company as a Junior Developer. I will strive to apply for companies with a good culture of mentorship and allowing for natural progression for young employees, always maintaining the ultimate goal of becoming a Senior Developer at a respected company.</p>
      <br></br>

      <!-- Alexander -->
      <li><h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Alexander</em></strong></h4></li>
      <p style="font-size:18px">I intend to work my way up to Systems Administration, by completing my studies at RMIT for the Bachelor of Information Technology. During this time, I will be looking for entry level help desk positions that will accommodate a student’s timetable so I am able to obtain some form of experience – depending on how frequently said position will roster me on, keeping my current retail job to the side. The entry level job will likely be starting out as Level 1 Help desk, working my way up the support career path to Administration. If my job allows me to upskill while working under the company, any upskilling will likely be undertaken with the company – or else I may undertake a Masters in Cybersecurity to further gain knowledge of a field I am interested in – this in turn would allow me to progress further or integrate aspects of Cybersecurity into my work. If a lot later down the track I decide to progress further with another relevant position – having the master’s degree will allow me to do so, if my job isn’t able to accommodate upskilling during work hours.</p>
      <br></br>

      <!-- MAtthew -->
      <li><h4 style="font-size:25px"><strong>Team Member: <em>Matthew</em></strong></h4></li>
      <p style="font-size:18px">In order to become a Data Analyst, I first intend to complete my Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT, specialising in Data Management. This will provide me with the skills to work with and analyse large amounts of data. The base course will also provide me with plenty of SQL experience, which I did not previously have, as well as increased familiarity with Python and other programming languages. With these skills and qualifications, I would apply for a entry-level data analytics role or similar, and from there gain experience in the workforce that can be used to move up or across into better jobs. There is the potential for me to extend my IT degree or complete more degrees in order to have competitive qualifications, but if I can get some experience and a good reference then I should be good to go.</p>
